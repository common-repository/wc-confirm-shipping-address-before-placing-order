Customer must confirm their entered shipping address on WooCommerce checkout page to place the order. Prevent incorrect entered shipping addresses.

== Description ==

A simple WooCommerce checkout plugin, that requires users to review their shipping address before being able to complete the order.

Upon checkout the customer will be presented with a popup/modal where they require to confirm/review the shipping address they entered. 

The customer will only be able to place/finalize their order after they give their confirmation that their shipping address was entered correctly.

After this they can proceed with making their payment as per usual.
